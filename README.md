This is a sandbox multi-app/widget dashboard application. The idea is to allow you to create and utilize small draggable applications all within one web page dashboard. For example, one might want to have a to-do list, their gmail inbox, and a google doc open all within one browser window. The application saves a users progress and widget placement. Many of these features are still in development!


Here's a live version of the application:
